<h1 id="virtualization"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#virtualization"></a>Virtualization</h1>
<p>Virtualization or virtualisation (sometimes abbreviated <code>v12n</code>, a numeronym) is the act of creating a <em>virtual</em> (rather than actual) version of something at the same abstraction level, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources. With virtualisationit is possibleto manage hardware like software.</p>
<p>Virtual processing shares the cloud providers :</p>
<ul>
<li>Processing Hardware</li>
<li>Disk &#x26; Storage</li>
<li>Memory</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Desktop</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hypervisor</strong> (also known as a <em>virtual machine monitor, VMM, or virtualizer</em>) is a type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. There are 2 types of hypervisor :</p>
<p>Type 1 - runs directly on the hardware. This hypervisor also provides the OS.<br>
Type 2 - hypervisor is managed by the OS like any other application</p>

<p>A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another. The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components. Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications.</p>
<p>A computer program that runs within a distributed system is called a distributed program (and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs). There are many different types of implementations for the message passing mechanism, including pure HTTP, RPC-like connectors and message queues.</p>

<p>Today's hardware are so fast that most of the time they are under-utilized. Including vitrualization allows the hardware to be utilized properly.</p>

<p>Running Virtual Machines makes much better use of existing hardware.</p>

<p>Scaling up a docker could involve a lot of re work on the environment but Kubernetes provides scaling &#x26; infrastructures as a service as the part of the product.</p>

<p>On Premises Computing enables the firm to control its hardware &#x26; any kind of data. It also eliminates any kind of mobility issues because the firm controls all of the hardware &#x26; all the data running on the hardware.</p>
