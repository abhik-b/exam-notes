Regression models describe the relationship between variables by fitting a line to the observed data. Linear regression models use a straight line, while logistic and nonlinear regression models use a curved line. Learn more [here](https://statsandr.com/blog/multiple-linear-regression-made-simple/)

## Simple linear regression 
Simple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between two quantitative variables. You can use simple linear regression when you want to know : How strong the relationship is between two variables (e.g. the relationship between rainfall and soil erosion).The value of the dependent variable at a certain value of the independent variable (e.g. the amount of soil erosion at a certain level of rainfall).

## Multiple linear regression 
Multiple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable. You can use multiple linear regression when you want to know: How strong the relationship is between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable (e.g. how rainfall, temperature, and amount of fertilizer added affect crop growth).The value of the dependent variable at a certain value of the independent variables (e.g. the expected yield of a crop at certain levels of rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer addition).
