The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components. Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications.</p>\n<p>A computer program that runs within a distributed system is called a distributed program (and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs). There are many different types of implementations for the message passing mechanism, including pure HTTP, RPC-like connectors and message queues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nist\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#nist\"></a>NIST</h2>\n<p>National Institute of Standards &#x26; Technology</p>\n<h3 id=\"service-models\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#service-models\"></a>Service Models</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Infrastructure as a service or <a href=\"/exam-notes/notes/pw0awx24u0w5y76vajehgs7\">IAAS</a></li>\n<li>Platform as a service or <a href=\"/exam-notes/notes/pw0awx24u0w5y76vajehgs7#paas\">PAAS</a></li>\n<li>Software as a service or <a href=\"/exam-notes/notes/pw0awx24u0w5y76vajehgs7#saas\">SAAS</a></li>\n<li>Functions as a service or <a href=\"/exam-notes/notes/pw0awx24u0w5y76vajehgs7#faas\">FAAS</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read More about <a href=\"/exam-notes/notes/pw0awx24u0w5y76vajehgs7\">Service Models</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"service-attributes\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#service-attributes\"></a>Service Attributes</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>On Demand Self Service</strong>\n: consumers can unilaterally provision computing capabilities as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.</li>\n<li><strong>Broad Network Access</strong>\n: capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanism that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms.</li>\n<li><strong>Resource Pooling</strong>\n:The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand</li>\n<li><strong>Rapid Elasticity</strong>\n: capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand.</li>\n<li><strong>Measured Service</strong>\n: cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"cloud-cube-model\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#cloud-cube-model\"></a>Cloud Cube Model</h2>\n<p>Has 4 dimensions :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Physical Location of data</em> : Internal/External</li>\n<li><em>OwnerShip</em> : Proprietary / Open</li>\n<li><em>Security Range</em> : DePerimeterized / Perimeterized</li>\n<li><em>Dimension</em> : Insourced/Outsourced</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read more from <a href=\"https://data-flair.training/blogs/cloud-cube-model/\">here</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"deployment-models\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#deployment-models\"></a>Deployment Models</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Community</li>\n<li>Hybrid</li>\n<li>Private</li>\n<li>Public</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"security\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#security\"></a>Security</h2>\n<p>Security can be a issue if cloud providers do not take necessary actions to guard the data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"auditing--compliances\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#auditing--compliances\"></a>Auditing &#x26; Compliances</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Cloud Audit</em></strong> is a specification for the presentation of information about cloud service providers' address <em>control framework</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Control Framework</em> - It is a data structure that organizes and categories organisation's internal control which are practices and procedures established to create business minimizes the risk.</p>\n<p>The <strong>goal of cloud audit</strong> is to provide cloud service providers with a way to make their peroformance and security data available for potential customers.
