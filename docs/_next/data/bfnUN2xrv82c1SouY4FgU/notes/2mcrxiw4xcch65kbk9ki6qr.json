The cloud is also referred to as very elastic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"private-deployment-model\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#private-deployment-model\"></a>Private Deployment Model</h2>\n<p>In this model , the firm controls or owns the data center providing cloud services. It does not use public internet , instead it is delivered on firm's private network so that the data stays within the firm &#x26; can be controlled by the firm. Private clouds can be: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>physical</strong>\n: where the firms have physical custody of the data center where cloud is hosted.</li>\n<li><strong>virtual</strong>\n: where a public cloud provider dedicated a set of computing resources for specific customer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>VPC uses a VPN (Virtual Private Network) approach to deliver Cloud Services over the firm's network. The VPN's allow firms to extend their network to outside data centers using internet connections. The firm does not has custody of data centers. With VPCs cloud provider has control of the data. Example : Amazon , IBM , Azure, Google all offer vpcs. A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is an on-demand configurable pool of shared computing resources allocated by a public Cloud provider, within a public cloud, delivering Cloud computing services over a virtual private network (VPN). The VPN permits or creates a sub-network that is part of the enterprise's network. However, the VPN uses the internet as a medium for the enterprise connection. The VPN permits the enterprise to virtually work virtually in private.</p>\n<p>The Private Cloud is Cloud computing services offered by an enterprise on its private internal network and only to select users  instead of the general public. Also referred to as an internal or corporate  cloud, private cloud computing gives businesses many of the benefits of Cloud computing such as: self-service, scalability, and elasticity. However, a private Cloud offered the enterprise control and customization of the data and hardware resources. The enterprise also has control over the computing infrastructure hosted on-premises. In addition, private  clouds deliver a higher level of security and privacy through both  company firewalls and internal hosting to ensure operations and  sensitive data are not accessible to third-party providers. One disadvantage is that the enterprise's IT department is held responsible for the cost  and accountability of managing the private cloud. So private clouds  require the same staffing, management, and maintenance expenses as  traditional data center ownership. </p>\n<h2 id=\"public-cloud-model\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#public-cloud-model\"></a>Public Cloud Model</h2>\n<p>A Public cloud is a deployment model where a firm uses the services of a 3rd Party Provider. The cloud computing services are delivered over public internet so it is generally available to all. They are invoiced on only what is used. Public Clouds are the data centers in a seismically stable locations. A Public Cloud is a 3rd party provider that makes computing services available to any individual or business that seeks to purchase the services. The services are delivered over the public internet. Public Clouds make services available in a \"pay as you go\" model, where customers can scale up, or down as needed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hybrid-cloud-model\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#hybrid-cloud-model\"></a>Hybrid Cloud Model</h2>\n<p>A Hybrid cloud is a mix of private , typically on-premises &#x26; 3rd party public cloud services. The <em>private components</em> of a Hybrid Cloud are typically commercial hardware, that have a hypervisor installed to manage the private cloud services. The <em>public components</em> are typically cloud provider such as Amazon or Azure.</p>\n<p>A popular approach is for firms to use <em>private cloud</em> for key data &#x26; <em>public cloud</em> for IAAS , and provides such services as computing &#x26; networking.</p>\n<p>A Hybrid Cloud is a mix between on-premises private Cloud and services from a public Cloud provider. The mix allows the enterprise to reduce some of the disadvantages, and risks of the public Cloud. The enterprise can use the private portion of the solution to manage private or sensitive data. This can also keep control of the critical data. The private component can also reduce the reliance on a 3rd party provider.\nThe public component of the Hybrid Cloud typically adds infrastructure as a service. The public component delivers processing, networking, test environments, and other items. A Hybrid Cloud delivers all the advantages of Cloud computing, while still managing the downsides and risks.    </p>\n<h2 id=\"high-performance-computing\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#high-performance-computing\"></a>High Performance Computing</h2>\n<p>HPC is actually an architecture of arrayed computers or processors. The architecture runs together in a cluster. A cluster is a group of computers acting as one. HPC uses parallel processing as a strategy.</p>\n<p>High Performance Computing (HPC) is a computing strategy involving parallel processing. The parallel processing is enabled by a cluster. A cluster is a group of computers acting as one computer. The processing is shared by all the computers in the cluster. This strategy allows more calculations per second.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/exam-notes/assets/images/2022-10-13-14-13-54.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"big-data-cloud\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#big-data-cloud\"></a>Big Data Cloud</h2>\n<p>Big data is a term for a family of strategies to analyze, extract information or trends from large , complex, data sets. This requires large amounts of storage &#x26; high performance processing . Cloud clusters can be dynamically implemented to efficiently process the big data sets. Cloud solutions are highly scalable as needs arise.</p>\n<p>Big Data is the concept of analyzing complex data sets. The data sets are so complex, that only powerful computing resources can identify trends and further analyze the data. Big data also require large amounts of storage for the complex data sets. Cloud computing can deliver the computing resources to storage and process Big Data's complex data sets.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/exam-notes/assets/images/2022-10-13-16-00-44.png\"></p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/exam-notes/notes/nx2wuyeo5kgob0u4jucsers\">Cloud Computing</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"gjr379x4uby1klukcwuuafc","title":"Root","desc":"","updated":1664424403234,"created":1663740327223,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"exam-notes"},"contentHash":"57c801f96fa00329063b52177f8e4b08","links":[],"anchors":{"notes-taken-by-abhik-b-for-competitive-exams":{"type":"header","text":"Notes taken by Abhik B for competitive exams","value":"notes-taken-by-abhik-b-for-competitive-exams","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["keojisysn3fz8lxhbdfcna4","nx2wuyeo5kgob0u4jucsers","gx0wes5gz0irclfjvffusa4","u8o7ksndu0na9g910fuglx5","4t4frfo11yj7dr8558kdhr1"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Notes taken by Abhik B for competitive exams\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"exam-notes"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"assetsPrefix":"/exam-notes","siteUrl":"https://abhik-b.github.io","siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Abhik B's Exam Notes","description":"Notes taken while studying computer applications"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
