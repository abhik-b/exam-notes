## What is software ?

A set of instructions to perform specific task is called program. The collection of one or many programs for a specific purpose is called a computer **software**.

## Different types of Software

### Application Software

Apllication softwares are designed for
performing specific task other than the basic ones carried out by computers. All such softwares are application specific & can't be understood by underlying hardware.

### Utility Software

This software is designed for users to assist in maintenance and monitoring activites. This is include anti virus software, firewalls.

### System Software

System SOftware can be viewd as softwarethat logical binds components of a computer to work as a single unit and provides the infrastructure over which can operate. It is responsiblefor controlling computer hardware & other resources and allows the application software to interact with computers to perform their task.
