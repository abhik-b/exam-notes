**Cloud computing** is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. It is a _pay-per-use_ model.

**Virtualization** or virtualisation (sometimes abbreviated v12n, a numeronym) is the act of creating a *virtual* (rather than actual) version of something at the same abstraction level, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.
Virtual processing shares the cloud providers :

- Processing Hardware
- Disk & Storage
- Memory
- Networking
- Desktop

**Hypervisor** (also known as a _virtual machine monitor, VMM, or virtualizer_) is a type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. There are 2 types of hypervisor :

Type 1 - runs directly on the hardware. This hypervisor also provides the OS.  
Type 2 - hypervisor is managed by the OS like any other application

A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another. The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components. Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications.

A computer program that runs within a distributed system is called a distributed program (and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs). There are many different types of implementations for the message passing mechanism, including pure HTTP, RPC-like connectors and message queues.

National Institute of Standards & Technology

- Platform as a service or [[#PAAS]]
- Software as a service or [[#SAAS]]

### Service Attributes

1. On Demand Self Service - consumers can unilaterally provision computing capabilities as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
2. Broad Network Access - capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanism that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms.
3. Resource Pooling - The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand
4. Rapid Elasticity - capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand.
5. Measured Service - cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service.

## Service Models

### IAAS

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service that offers essential stuff on a pay-as-you-go basis :

- compute,
- storage, and
- networking resources on demand

It offers virtual servers, desktops,security & networking. IAAS makes it possible for smaller firms to have same infrastructure as any large firm.
Common use cases : Developement & testing Environments. Developing & Testing in a environment that emulates production is best scenario for quality.

## Cloud Cube Model

Has 4 dimensions :

- _Physical Location of data_ : Internal/External
- _OwnerShip_ : Proprietary / Open
- _Security Range_ : DePerimeterized / Perimeterized
- _Dimension_ : Insourced/Outsourced

## Deployment Models

- Community
- Hybrid
- Private
- Public

So I am adding this changes
